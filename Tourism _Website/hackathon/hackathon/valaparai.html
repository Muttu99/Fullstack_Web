        <h6><p>Valparai takes you through the forest, perfectly landscaped tea gardens and sometimes an encounter with elephants, leopards or other wildlife! 
            The beautiful hill station shares its boundary with Anamalai Tiger Reserve, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, Eravikulam National Park, and Vazhachal Forest Division and as a result,
             it's a haven for animals such as elephants, wild boars, mountain goats, black monkeys, and leopards.</p><br/>
             Annamalai wildlife sanctuary<br/>
            <p>Annamalai wildlife sanctuary is located at an altitude of 1,400 meters and is full of wildlife such as pangolins, sloth bear, panther, elephant, tiger, gaur, deer, etc.</p>
            <br/>
           <p> Aaliyar Dam <br/>
            Located at Aliyar in the foothills of Valparai, is a famous picnic spot near the dam. The park opens at 8.30 am and closes at 5.30 pm, with a very minimum entry charge. With very few visitors during the week days, this is easily one of the best places to visit at Valparai.
         </p><br/>
         Birla Falls<br/>
        <p>Your journey to Birla falls will take you 2 km away from Valparai and the path is surrounded by tea fields. 
        Watching the waterfall in the mid-green tea fields is a pleasant view for the eyes.</p><br/>
        Manompally forest<br/>
        <p>This reserve forest has adventurous treks and a high probability to sight some of the endangered species. 
        There is a trekking shed( rest house) on the banks of Manompally river which doubles up as a base camp for those bent on adventure. 
        Prior permission from the Forest Department required.</p><br/>
        Grass Hills<br/>
        <p>It probably is one of the most secluded, most beautiful, most enchanting and the most peaceful place on earth.
             The shola grasslands are a unique ecosystem that hosts species like the Nilgiri tahr and Nilgiri Pipit which are not found anywhere else in the world. 
             Nature lovers would love to explore this spot and prior permission from the Forest Department is required.</p><br/>
